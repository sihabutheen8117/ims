AIM

To prepare a detailed Network Security Audit Checklist for two IT companies by creating relevant audit questionnaires for the 10 essential steps of a network audit, helping organizations move from vulnerable to secure.

ALGORITHM

Identify and define the audit scope.

List all potential threats for both companies.

Review internal security policies.

Inspect sensitive data storage and access control.

Review server security and configuration.

Examine training logs and logging mechanisms.

Verify secure internet access policies.

Conduct penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.

Share audit findings with relevant teams.

Establish frequency of regular network audits.

PROCEDURE

Select two IT companies (imaginary or real).

For each of the 10 steps, prepare suitable audit questions.

Create a checklist format with columns for Company A & B.

Fill responses as “Yes/No”.

Add remarks where required.

Compile the entire checklist and present it for evaluation.
